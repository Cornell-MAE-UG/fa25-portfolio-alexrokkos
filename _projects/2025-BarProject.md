**Objective:** The goal of this design was to lift a weight to the maximum height possible within the defined space. Using one bar, 3 joints, and a actuator I deisgned a device that lifted some weight to the max height, using the moment that the actuator creates with the bar. The bar reaches it maximum height when the force from the actuator is perpendicular to the bar.

Revisiting Bar Actuator Project

**Orginal Problem**:The intent of this project was to lift a weight to the greatest height possible within a pre-defined space. Using one bar, 3 joints, and a actuator I thought up a device that lifted some weight to the max height, using the moment that the actuator creates through the contact with bar. The bar reaches it maximum height when the force from the actuator is perpendicular to the bar

**Constraints**: We could only use one bar, 3 joints, and a actuator.

**DOF** My orginal probelm had two degrees of freedom, the length of the actuator and the angle of the actuator.

**Changes**: After reviisting the problem to take into account the beam bending, I preformed calculations to decide the best shape and material of the beam. The turned out to be al with a E of about 69 GPa and a cross section of a circle, with diameter of about 12 cm. This assume the weight is 1 kN.
