**Objective:** The goal of this design was to lift a weight to the maximum height possible within the defined space. Using one bar, three joints, and an actuator, I designed a device that lifts a load efficiently while staying within the project constraints.

Revisiting Bar Actuator Project

---

**Original Problem:** The intent of this project was to lift a weight to the greatest height possible within a pre-defined space. Using one bar, three joints, and an actuator, I conceptualized a device that achieves this by optimizing linkage geometry and actuator travel.

**Constraints:** We could only use one bar, three joints, and one actuator.

**DOF:** The original problem had two degrees of freedom: the actuator length and the actuator angle.

**Changes:** After revisiting the problem to take beam bending into account, I performed calculations to decide the best beam shape and material. The calculations identified an appropriate Young's modulus and cross-section to limit deflection while meeting weight and space constraints.
