**Objective:** The goal of this design was to lift a weight to the maximum height possible within the defined space. Using one bar, 3 joints, and a actuator I deisgned a device that lifted some weight to the max height, using the moment that the actuator creates with the bar. The bar reaches it maximum height when the force from the actuator is perpendicular to the bar.
